Contribution Guidelines
=======================

Guidelines for new Issues
-------------------------

There are a several types of issues.  The most common are bug fixes, but some
will be oriented toward feature requests.

New bugfix issues should contain a full description of how to repeat the
problem identified.  If the problem cannot be repeated, then the issue
may be closed due to lack of information.

Feature request issues may warrant discussion in that thread.  It is expected
that some features may be implemented in the future, but this project is not intended
to be the `pytest` or the `django` of manufacturing test and, thus, I don't anticipate
a large feature set.

Guidelines for Pull Requests
----------------------------

I am not a full-time project maintainer.  I'm a dude with a job.  That means
that pull requests have to be relatively self-contained in order to make the
cut.  Having said that, I don't think that the bar is too high in this
instance.

It is advised to create a pull request against one or more issues which are
already documented.  The risk of simply adding features is that your cool
new whiz-bang feature is simply not a part of the author's vision for the
project... meaning that you just did a bunch of work for nothing.  Neither
of us wants that.

New pull requests shall:

* have an explanation of the feature or bugfix that they are implementing (preferabley with an issue number to refer to)
* have some test coverage for that feature/bugfix
* be `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ compliant as defined by `flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ test

Executing Automated Testing
---------------------------

The packages required in order to execute the automated testing can be found
in the `test_requirements.txt` file at the base of the
`github repository <https://github.com/slightlynybbled/mats>`_.  As of this
writing, the test coverage is at 96% and any new functionality will be required
to be backed up by testing.

To get set up for testing, fork the repository to your user.  You may then
clone the github repository, install all requirements, install the repository
in ``develop`` mode:

.. code-block:: text

    $> git clone https://github.com/<your_user_name>/mats
    $> pip install -r test_requirements.txt
    $> pip install -r requirements.txt
    $> python setup.py develop

Run all tests using::

    $> py.test tests/

Then run the style checker using::

    $> flake8 mats

Future Development
------------------

Features that I foresee:

 * More dynamic ``ArchiveManager``
    * sqlite
    * excel
 * Qt-based GUI

Have `others <https://github.com/slightlynybbled/mats/issues>`_?
