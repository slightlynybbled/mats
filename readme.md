`MATS` is a hardware-oriented test environment intended for production testing in a manufacturing 
environment.  The `MATS` framework is a test template and test sequence executor only, so there 
are no considerations for user interaction, meaning that you need to supply your own "start" button.

MATS could be considered an automated test framework which imposes a consistent work flow and
reduces the amount of mind share that you need to dedicate to developing automated device tests.

Checkout the [documentation](https://mats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more details!

There is a ready-to-run GUI using tkinter over at the [TkMATS](https://github.com/slightlynybbled/tkmats).  
This is very useful to get a manufacturing test up quickly and easily.  Enjoy!
